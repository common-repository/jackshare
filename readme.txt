Super simple Social media sharing buttons with minimal design and lightning fast performance.

== Description ==

Jackshare plugin is a really simple plugin to share your content on social media with clean code and structure. Most social media sharing plugins load your site with useless functions and this affecting your site's load time.


You can choose between those settings:

*   Choose which social networks you want to display.
*   Make your buttons colored or transparent
*   Give style to your buttons as round, square and radius.
*   Enable or disable Social Media name in buttons

Facebook Settings:

*   Enable Facebook Meta Tags on header (This is something optional and you should use it ONLY if you haven't activated another plugin for SEO.)

*   Enable Shares Counter. Works with latest api Facebook version 3.7 and supports Share counter, Reaction counter & Comment Counter.
